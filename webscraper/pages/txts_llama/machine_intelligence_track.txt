Machine Intelligence Track
Objectives
The track is designed to prepare students to work in fields related to analysis of data, including areas such as machine learning,
artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and data mining. The track is designed to prepare students to understand, and
effectively apply in practice, the principles and techniques of data and knowledge representation, search, as well as learning
and reasoning with data.
All major required courses, all track requirements and track selectives, and their pre-requisites, regardless
of department, must be completed with a grade of C or better.
