COLLEGE BOARD ADVANCED PLACEMENT CREDIT
The College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Program allows you to establish college credit
from tests taken at the completion of high school AP courses.
The sections below provide information about AP credit Purdue accepts and the scores necessary to earn credit.
Course numbers listed as "1XXXX" transfer as undistributed credit, which means Purdue does not have an equivalent course. Such credit
appears on a Purdue student record as credit hours within the respective subject area. You should consult with your Purdue academic
advisor to determine how undistributed credit may be used to best meet curriculum requirements within your area of study.
