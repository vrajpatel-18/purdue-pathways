Programming Language Track
Objectives
The track is designed to prepare students to work in fields related to program understanding, analysis, manipulation and
transformation.  This includes run-time system engineering as well as domain specific techniques (e.g., real-time computing or
web programming). They will acquire tools and techniques needed to specify and implement language-based solutions.
All major required courses, all track requirements and track selectives, and their pre-requisites, regardless
of department, must be completed with a grade of C or better.
