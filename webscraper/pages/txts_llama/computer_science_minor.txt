Notes
      Enrollment in
      all CS
      courses is
      subject to
      space
      availability
      and CS
      majors are
      given priority
      in registering
      for all CS
      courses.  The
      CS
      department
      cannot
      guarantee
      students
      seeking a CS
      minor access
      to courses.
      All Course
      prerequisites
      must be met
---
to enroll in
any Computer
Science
course.  No
overrides for
prerequisites
will be
approved.
All courses
used for the
minor must be
taken at
Purdue
University
West
Lafayette
campus.
CS Minors are
limited to five
(5) CS
courses.
Students are
responsible
for
understanding
our Course
Access &
Request
policy,
knowing
registration
timelines, and
for requesting
space
through the
correct
process.
*Students
with AP CS
credit plus a
passing score
in the CS
18000 Proficie
ncy Exam (as
described
above) may
use their AP
credit in place
of CS
18000 as a
pre-requisite
for other CS
courses, but
AP credit will
not count
toward the
five (5) CS
courses. In
this case, the
student must
choose three
of the Elective
---
       Courses.
       **Math majors
       may use MA
       37500 in
       place of CS
       18200 as a
       pre-requisite
       for other CS
       courses, but
       MA 37500 will
       not count
       toward the
       five (5) CS
       courses.  In
       this case, the
       student must
       choose three
       of the Elective
       Courses.
