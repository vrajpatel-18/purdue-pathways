Systems Software Track
Objectives
The track is designed to prepare students to become programmers who can build
low-level software that uses or runs inside an operating system,
system tools for other users (e.g., compilers and assemblers),
programs that communicate over a computer network or the Internet (e.g., web servers).
All major required courses, all track requirements and track selectives, and their pre-requisites, regardless of department, must be completed with a grade of C or better
.
Required Courses (3)
Course
Title
CS 35200
Compilers: Principles and Practice
CS 35400
Operating Systems
CS 42200
Computer Networks
The track requires three electives, chosen from the list below. In addition to elective courses listed, other courses, including project and independent study courses, will be approved as electives, provided the course involves systems programming (as opposed to web page scripting, or other high-level application programming). Faculty strongly recommend that students include a senior project as one of the three electives.
