Computer Graphics and Visualization Track
Objectives
The track is designed to prepare students for work and/or for graduate school in computer graphics, visualization, and related areas.  Computer graphics refers to modeling (including 3D acquisition) and rendering 3D objects and scenes. Visualization refers to using imagery to convey digital information and facilitate its interpretation and analysis. Jobs and activities for students graduating from this track may include:
Graphics-related Industry jobs (e.g., Intel, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Google) - working on graphics software, hardware, and applications.
CAD and Architectural Applications - developing CAD/Engineering/Architecture related applications.
Movie Industry (e.g., Pixar, Dreamworks, Disney, Sony) – working on creating movies and related tools.
Gaming Industry (e.g., Electronic Arts, Midway Games, Disney, Sony) – working on game programming and related tools.
Laboratories - working in one of several scientific visualization laboratories (though often a graduate degree is preferred).
Graduate school - continuing studies towards a MS or PhD which opens up other job opportunities including research labs and academic positions.
All major required courses, all track requirements and track selectives, and their pre-requisites, regardless of department, must be completed with a grade of C or better
.
