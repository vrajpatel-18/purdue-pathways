Science Technology and Society Requirement
Curricular Outcome: Ability to function in a multidisciplinary setting.
The Science Technology and Society (STS) requirement is met by completing a                                           Science, Technology and Society course
(https://www.purdue.edu/provost/students/s-initiatives/curriculum/courses.html).
Note: Students completing the Statewide General Transfer Core will not meet the Science Technology and Society UCORE
outcome and therefore, must complete an STS course.
