About the Program
Purdue Computer Science is one of the country’s top-ranked programs. Faculty members are shaping the future of information
technology through cutting-edge research. Students can take courses that include such topics as graphics and animation, web
programming, competitive programming, cryptography and security, networks, software engineering, distributed systems,
information systems, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics.
The Purdue University Department of Computer Science has a comprehensive and exciting curriculum for its undergraduate
students. The flexible curriculum offers adventurous young women and men an excellent opportunity to be involved in a
dynamic discipline that will continue to grow and to contribute significantly to progress in many other disciplines and
ultimately to changes in human society that are nothing short of profound. Students learn communication skills, teamwork, and
problem-solving skills and acquire the necessary technical skills for positions in computing in nearly any industry.
Computer Science students begin by taking six core courses that teach them the fundamentals of computer science. Students
can then select one or more tracks, which allow them to deepen their understanding in a specific area (or areas) of Computer
Science. These academic tracks include:
Computer Science Concentration - Computational Science and Engineering Track  
Computer Science Concentration - Computer Graphics and Visualization Track  
Computer Science Concentration - Database and Information Systems Track (DBIS)  
Computer Science Concentration - Foundations of Computer Science Track (FCS)  
Computer Science Concentration - Machine Intelligence Track (MI)  
Computer Science Concentration - Programming Language Track (PL)  
Computer Science Concentration - Security Track  
Computer Science Concentration - Software Engineering Track  
Computer Science Concentration - Systems Programming Track (Systems)

Curriculum and Degree Requirements for College of Science
A College of Science degree is conferred when a student successfully completes all requirements in their degree
program.  Students will complete coursework or approved experiential learning activities to meet the following three degree
components:
1. Major
2. Science Core Curriculum
3. Electives3/10/24, 2:26 PM Program: Computer Science, BS - Purdue University - Acalog ACMS™
https://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=10&poid=12802&returnto=13413&print 2/7Students may use any of the following options to meet College of Science degree requirements:
Purdue Coursework
Ap, IB, and CLEP credit.  The use of AP and IB coursework varies between College of Science degree plans.
Transfer Credit . Students should consult the Admissions Transfer Credit Resource page for all available transfer
options.
College of Science degree programs vary widely in their approval and use of the proceeding options and thus students are
strongly encouraged to work closely with their academic advisors and to regularly consult their MyPurduePlan to view the
use of each option in their degree plan. 
Most College of Science degree programs contain elective credits students may use to pursue courses that relate to their in -
terests or which support their major area of study. The elective area of a degree plan may also be used to complete minors ,
second majors and certificates such as the Entrepreneurial Certificate. With the exception of courses on the No Count List,
any Purdue course may be used to meet the elective area of a student’s degree plan.
College of Science Core Requirements
All Students starting Purdue University Fall semester, 2007 or later are required to pursue the 2007 Science Core
curriculum.
The College of Science Core Curriculum requires the completion of approved coursework and/or experiential learning op -
portunities in the following academic areas:
Composition and Presentation  
Computing   
Cultural Diversity (Language and Culture)   
General Education  
Great Issues in Science   
Laboratory Science   
Mathematics    
Multidisciplinary Experience  
Statistics   
Teambuilding and Collaboration    
No Count List   
Earning Core Curricular Requirements through Experience
Students may meet selected core curriculum requirements through approved experiential learning opportunities. Interested
students should contact their academic advisor for more information on this option and incorporating experiential learning
into their four-year program of study. For more information on earning requirements through experience, please click here .

https://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=10&poid=12802&returnto=13413&print 7/7***All CS core courses and all track requirements, regardless of department, must be completed with a grade of “C” or
higher. 
All prerequisites to CS core courses and track requirements, regardless of department, must be completed with a grade
of C or higher.
Enrollment in freshman seminar courses CS 19100  and CS 19300  is required with CS 18000 . They are not degree
requirements. CS 29100 - Sophomore Development Seminar  and CS 39100 - Junior Resources Seminar  are optional
but recommended.
Foreign Language Courses
Foreign Language proficiency requirements vary by program. 
For acceptable languages and proficiency levels, see your advisor: American Sign Language, Arabic, Chinese,
French, German, (ancient) Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish
Critical Course
The    course is considered critical.
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana’s Public Colleges and Universities, published by the
Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348-2013), a Critical Course is identified as “one that a
student must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses,
for example, should know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be suc -
cessful.  These would be identified by the institutions for each degree program”. 
Disclaimer
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and
completion.
