College of Science
About the Program
Purdue Computer Science is one of the country’s top-ranked programs. Faculty members are shaping the future of information technology through cutting-edge research. Students can take courses that include such topics as graphics and animation, web programming, competitive programming, cryptography and security, networks, software engineering, distributed systems, information systems, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics.
The flexible curriculum offers students the opportunity to be involved in a dynamic discipline that will continue to grow and to contribute significantly to progress in many other disciplines and ultimately to changes in human society that are nothing short of profound. Students learn communication skills, teamwork, and problem-solving skills and acquire the necessary technical skills for positions in computing throughout society.

Computer Science Major Change (CODO) Requirements
Computer Science students begin by taking six core courses that teach them the fundamentals of computer science. Students then take coursework in a concentration, which allows them to deepen their understanding in a specific area. The Systems Software track is designed to prepare students to become programmers who can build…
low-level software that uses or runs inside an operating system,
system tools for other users (e.g., compilers and assemblers),
programs that communicate over a computer network or the Internet (e.g., web servers).

Degree Requirements
120 Credits Required
Curriculum and Degree Requirements for College of Science
A College of Science degree is conferred when a student successfully completes all requirements in their degree program.  Students will complete coursework or approved experiential learning activities to meet the following three degree components:
Major
Science Core Curriculum
Electives
Students may use any of the following options to meet College of Science degree requirements:
Purdue Coursework
AP, IB, and CLEP credit.  The use of AP and IB coursework varies between College of Science degree plans.
Transfer Credit
. Students should consult the Admissions Transfer Credit Resource page for all available transfer options.
College of Science degree programs vary widely in their approval and use of the proceeding options and thus students are strongly encouraged to work closely with their academic advisors and to regularly consult their MyPurduePlan to view the use of each option in their degree plan. 
Most College of Science degree programs contain elective credits students may use to pursue courses that relate to their interests or which support their major area of study. The elective area of a degree plan may also be used to complete 
minors
, second majors and certificates such as the Entrepreneurial Certificate. With the exception of courses on the No Count List, any Purdue course may be used to meet the elective area of a student’s degree plan.
College of Science Core Requirements
All Students starting Purdue University Fall semester, 2007 or later are required to pursue the 2007 Science Core curriculum.
The College of Science Core Curriculum requires the completion of approved coursework and/or experiential learning opportunities in the following academic areas:
Composition and Presentation
Computing

World Language Courses
World Language proficiency requirements vary by program. The following list is inclusive of all world languages PWL offers for credit; for acceptable languages and proficiency levels, see your advisor. (ASL-American Sign Language; ARAB-Arabic; CHNS-Chinese; FR-French; GER-German; GREK-Greek(Ancient); HEBR-Hebrew(Biblical); HEBR-Hebrew(Modern); ITAL-Italian; JPNS-Japenese; KOR-Korean; LATN-Latin; PTGS=Portuguese; RUSS-Russian; SPAN-Spanish)
Critical Course
The ♦ course is considered critical.
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana’s Public Colleges and Universities, published by the Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348-2013), a Critical Course is identified as “one that a student must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.  These would be identified by the institutions for each degree program”. 
Disclaimer
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.
Consultation with an advisor may result in an altered plan customized for an individual student.
The myPurduePlan powered by DegreeWorks is the knowledge source for specific requirements and completion.
