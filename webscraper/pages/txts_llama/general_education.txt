General Education Requirement
Outcome: Demonstrated breadth of knowledge and cultural appreciation. College of Science students gain insights
into the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Management to deepen their awareness of other disciplines of thought, which
complements and informs their scientific understanding of the world. Students complete the General Education requirement
by completing three courses (9 credits) from the approved course list. Students are encouraged to speak with their academic
advisors about course options that expand their perspectives and further develop analytical and critical thinking skills.
Curricular Notices:
         Students may use only ONE course (3 credits) from the following subjects: AGEC, MGMT, OBHR, ECON, or ENTR to
         meet their general education requirement.
         Approved courses may be combined to satisfy the General Education requirement. Note: The presence of a course on the
         approved list does not guarantee the course will be available during all terms.
         Some courses on the General Education approved course list share the same course subject and number but have different
         titles. Only those titles listed are approved. Consult with your advisor if you have a question about the suitability of a
         course.
         Courses taken to meet the General Education requirement may not also be used to meet the Cultural Diversity (Language
         and Culture) or Great Issues requirement.
         Students are encouraged to nominate courses for the general education requirement. Please submit course suggestions to
         your academic advisor.
