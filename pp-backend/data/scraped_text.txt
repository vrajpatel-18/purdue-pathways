Computer Science Degree Requirements
The first six (core) courses, which are taken in the freshman and sophomore years, lay a strong foundation for computer science majors. Each student then selects a Track in which to complete 6 advanced courses. Each Track has 2-4 Required Courses and a list of potential electives. A student may complete more than one Track if desired.
The flexibility of the Computer Science curriculum comes from requiring only six foundational (core) courses followed by one or more Tracks, which allow students to deepen their understanding in a specific area of computer science. Some intersection between tracks allows specialization in multiple areas, for example, Systems Programming and Software Engineering.
All beginning computer science majors are required to take 
CS 19300
, Tools. This is a 1 credit course that Computer Science students take in their first semester. Students are equally encouraged to take 
CS 29100
, Sophomore Development Seminar, and 
CS 39100
, Junior Resource Seminar.
All major required courses, all track requirements and track selectives, and their pre-requisites, regardless of department, must be completed with a grade of C or better
.
