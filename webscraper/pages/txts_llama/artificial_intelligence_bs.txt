                                           Program
                                           Artificial Intelligence (AI)
                                           systems are increasingly
                                           being deployed for real-world
                                           tasks. Students in the AI
                                           major will master the
                                           foundations and tools for
                                           building and understanding
                                           artificial intelligence systems
                                           which reason about data,
                                           correct themselves, and
                                           make decisions. Students
                                           will explore the link between
                                           cognitive psychology,
                                           neuroscience, and AI, and
                                           the ethics of AI, which are
                                           integral to a holistic
                                           understanding of AI. The
                                           major will open pathways to
                                           new careers ranging from
                                           healthcare and sustainability
                                           to business and economics.

is conferred when a student
successfully completes all
requirements in their degree
program.  Students will
complete coursework or
approved experiential
learning activities to meet the
following three degree
components:
  1. Major
  2. Science Core Curriculum
  3. Electives
Students may use any of the
following options to meet
College of Science degree
requirements:
     Purdue Coursework
     AP, IB, and CLEP credit.
     The use of AP and IB
     coursework varies
     between College of
     Science degree plans.
     Transfer Credit. Students
     should consult the
     Admissions Transfer
     Credit Resource page
     for all available transfer
     options.
College of Science degree
programs vary widely in their
approval and use of the
proceeding options and thus
students are strongly
encouraged to work closely
with their academic advisors
and to regularly consult their
MyPurduePlan to view the
use of each option in their
degree plan.
Most College of Science
degree programs contain
elective credits students may
use to pursue courses that
relate to their interests or
which support their major
area of study. The elective
area of a degree plan may
also be used to complete
minors, second majors and
certificates such as the
Entrepreneurial
Certificate. With the
exception of courses on the
No Count List, any Purdue
course may be used to meet
the elective area of a
student’s degree plan.
College of Science Core

Pass/No Pass
Option Policy
     Only free electives and
     courses at the 50000-
     level general education
     requirement may be
     taken under the
     pass/not-pass option.
     The pass/not-pass
     grade mode may be
     entered for courses
     which are not required
     by a student’s major(s),
     minor(s) or science core
     curriculum.
     Grade mode Passing is
     equivalent to at a
     minimum grade of C-
     had a letter grade been
     awarded.
     Students may elect to
     use the pass/not-pass
     option for no more than
     20% of the 124/120
     credit requirement for
     graduation and for no
     more than two courses
     per academic year (Fall-
     Summer).
     The pass/not-pass
     option cannot be elected
     for a course that has
     already been completed
     with a letter grade.
     University Regulation.
     Students may take
     elective credit while
     abroad using the P/NP
     mode.  In the case of
     universities which only
     post P/NP, the
     University will apply a
     calculation process to
     determine a letter grade.
     Department of
     Languages and Cultures

Transfer Credit
---
Policy
College of Science degree
programs vary widely in their
approval and use of non-
Purdue originated credit (AP,
IB, CLEP, and transfer credit).
Students work closely with
their academic advisors and
degree plan audits to
review the use and approval
of each non-Purdue credit
option.

    Requirement
    The Civics Literacy
    Proficiency activities are
    designed to develop
    civic knowledge of
    Purdue students in an
    effort to graduate a
    more informed
    citizenry. For more
    information visit the
    Civics Literacy
    Proficiency website.
    Students will complete the
    Proficiency by passing a
---
    test of civic knowledge,
    and completing one of
    three paths:
         Attending six
         approved civics-
         related events and
         completing an
         assessment for each;
         or
         Completing 12
         podcasts created by
         the Purdue Center for
         C-SPAN Scholarship
         and Engagement that
         use C-SPAN material
         and completing an
         assessment for each;
         or
         Earning a passing
         grade for one
         of these approved
         courses (or
         transferring in
         approved AP or
         departmental credit in
         lieu of taking a
         course).
    Upper Level
    Requirement
         Resident study at
         Purdue University for
         at least two
         semesters and the
         enrollment in and
         completion of at least
         32 semester hours of
         coursework required
         and approved for the
         completion of the
         degree. These
         courses are expected
         to be at least junior-
         level
         (30000+) courses.
         Students should be
         able to fulfill most, if
         not all, of these
         credits within their
         major requirements;
         there should be a
         clear pathway for
         students to complete
         any credits not
         completed within
         their major.

Critical Course
---
        The ♦ course is
        considered
        critical.
        In alignment with
        the Degree Map
        Guidance for
        Indiana’s Public
        Colleges and
        Universities,
        published by the
        Commission for
        Higher Education
        (pursuant to HEA
        1348-2013), a
        Critical Course is
        identified as “one
        that a student
        must be able to
        pass to persist
        and succeed in a
        particular major.
         Students who
        want to be
        nurses, for
        example, should
        know that they
        are expected to
        be proficient in
        courses like
        biology in order
        to be successful.
        These would be
        identified by the
        institutions for
        each degree
        program”.
Disclaimer
        The student is
        ultimately
        responsible for
        knowing and
        completing all
        degree
        requirements.
        Consultation with
        an advisor may
        result in an
        altered plan
        customized for
        an individual
        student.
