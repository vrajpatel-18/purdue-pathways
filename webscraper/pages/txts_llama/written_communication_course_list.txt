Course Listing
Below is also a complete listing of approved Purdue West Lafayette courses that may be used for
meeting foundational learning outcomes.  Some courses may have start terms (e.g. Fall 2013 and
after only) or end terms (e.g. Fall 2019 and earlier only). Courses taken outside the noted terms do
not meet the outcome.
An Excel spreadsheet of all approved courses (courses taken at Purdue campuses and other Indiana
institutions as well as transfer courses) may also be found here (UCC-Master-Course-List-PWL-
Transfer.xlsx). (documents/UCC_Master_Course_List_current.xlsx)
