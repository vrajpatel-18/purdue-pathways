Computational Science and Engineering Track
Objectives
This track introduces students to computational methods, systems, and algorithms useful for modeling complex problems in
applications of science and engineering.
All major required courses, all track requirements and track selectives, and their pre-requisites, regardless
of department, must be completed with a grade of C or better.
