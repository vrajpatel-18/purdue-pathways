Plan of Study
Courses used to fulfill degree requirements must be listed on a plan of study and submitted for approval by the Graduate Committee and the Graduate School well before the final session. Grades in the A range (A+, A, A-) or B range (B+, B, B-) are expected, but one or two grades in the C range may be accepted if they are compensated by grades in the A range (regardless of + and -). Other grades are unacceptable. The GPA of the courses on the plan must be at least 3.0. CS 69800, Research M.S. Thesis, is not listed on the plan of study.
Master's programs typically take three or four semesters. The practical maximum load is four courses per semester and two in the summer session. Students with assistantships rarely take more than three courses per semester and one in the summer session. Completing a master's program within twelve months is sometimes possible for well-prepared, industrious students.
The deadline for final submission of the MS plan of study:
Not later than April 1st if planning to receive the degree the following August or December
Not later than November 1st if planning to receive the degree the following May

Advisory Committee
For students in a non-thesis master's program, the role of the advisory committee will be fulfilled by the chair of the department's graduate committee.
For students in a thesis master's program, the advisory committee consists of the supervisor of the research plus two or more other faculty members agreed upon by the student and the supervisor. Qualified faculty from other departments may serve on the committee but may not form a majority of it.

 if this course is not available to you in Brightspace.
2.  Ethics Research Training
Non-Thesis Option Students:
Non-thesis MS students must pass the 
Responsible Conduct of Research
(RCR)
 Training for 
Undergraduate Students
 on-line test at 
CITI Program
 and forward the certificate to the Graduate Office at 
csgrad@purdue.edu
 with the subject "Ethics Requirement". Go to the 
CITI Program website
 and register with Purdue University as your Organization Affiliation.
Thesis Option Students:
Thesis MS students must pass the 
Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)

Communication Requirement
All MS students that entered after spring 2008 must demonstrate effectiveness in communication.
For students using the thesis option, this will be assessed in the normal course of their program.
For students using the non-thesis option this can be assessed on the basis of presentations and papers in courses. Students should ask a CS faculty member from whom they have taken a course and in whose judgment they have demonstrated effectiveness in communication to inform the graduate office by sending an e-mail to 
csgrad@purdue.edu
 with the subject "Communication Requirement".
Otherwise, the student must write a technical essay at the beginning of the final semester and submit it to the chair of the Graduate Committee for evaluation. A research paper may also be used if the student is the sole author.
The deadline for completion of the communication requirement:
Not later than April 1st if planning to receive the degree the following August or December
Not later than November 1st if planning to receive the degree the following May
Back to top
Changes in Requirements
These requirements apply to all students entering or reentering the Department of Computer Sciences at West Lafayette ("the Department") as degree-seeking graduate students in the summer session of 2013 or later. For students entering prior to summer 2013, refer to the 
2008 master's degree requirements.
Students are governed by the degree requirements in effect when they enter the Department as degree-seeking students. Students who wish to take advantage of subsequent changes may apply to the Graduate Committee to be governed by 
all degree requirements
 in effect at a specified subsequent time. Choosing features from different sets of requirements is not permitted.
For students re-entering, the date of the most recent re-entry determines the degree requirements.
The above requirements for the master's program may change without notice.
