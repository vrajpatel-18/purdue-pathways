Laboratory Science Mathematics/Statistics/Computing
Curricular Outcome: Ability to think and function as a scientist
College of Science students will complement critical thinking and analytical abilities gained within their major area of study by
completing a two-course sequence and related laboratory experience in a science outside of their major. Students are also
required to develop proficiency and knowledge in the areas of mathematics, statistics, and computer science.

Laboratory Science
The laboratory science requirement is met by completion of a one-year sequence of laboratory science.
College of Science students are strongly encouraged by our faculty to complete laboratory courses with in-person laboratory
experiences.
List of Approved Lab Science Courses

Mathematics
         The Mathematics requirement is met by completion of a one-year sequence of single variable calculus. The following
         sequences are approved to meet the math requirement:
         MA 16100: Plane Analytic Geometry and Calculus I (5 cr.) AND MA 16200: Plane Analytic Geometry and Calculus II (5
         cr.) OR MA 16500: Analytic Geometry and Calculus I (4 cr.) AND MA 16600: Analytic Geometry and Calculus II (4 cr.)
Note: MA 16100/MA 16500 AND MA 16200/16600 may be interchanged to meet the single variable calculus requirement.
Biology Majors only: MA 16010: Applied Calculus I and MA 16020: Applied Calculus II
