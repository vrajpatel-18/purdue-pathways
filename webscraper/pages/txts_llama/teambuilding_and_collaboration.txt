Teambuilding and Collaboration
Curricular Outcome: ability to collaborate as part of a team. Students will learn the concepts involved in Teaming and
Collaboration, such as leadership, developing shared goals, and utilizing strengths of team members. These foundations will
allow them to then enter collaborative situations fully prepared to maximize the value of their educational experiences as well
as develop positive working relationships with their fellow students.
The Teaming and Collaboration core requirement is met through completion of coursework or an approved
experiential learning contract.
      Approved Teaming Experience Courses
Curricular Change: The 2007 Science Core curriculum originally included a Teaming Principles course requirement in addition
to the Teaming Experience requirement. The Teaming Principle requirement was removed by faculty vote spring semester,
2013. Students having completed an approved Teaming Principles course will use this course as a free elective. All continuing
students effective spring, 2013 are affected by this curricular change.
