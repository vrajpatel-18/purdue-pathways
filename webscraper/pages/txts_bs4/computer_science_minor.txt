Notes
Enrollment in all CS courses is subject to space availability and CS majors are given priority in registering for all CS courses.  The CS department cannot guarantee students seeking a CS minor access to courses.  
All Course prerequisites must be met to enroll in any Computer Science course.  No overrides for prerequisites will be approved.
All courses used for the minor must be taken at Purdue University West Lafayette campus.
CS Minors are limited to five (5) CS courses.
Students are responsible for understanding our 
Course Access & Request policy
, knowing registration timelines, and for requesting space through the correct process.
*Students with AP CS credit plus a passing score in the 
CS 18000
 Proficiency Exam
 (as described above) may use their AP credit in place of 
CS 18000
 as a pre-requisite for other CS courses, but
 AP credit will not count
 toward the five (5) CS courses. In this case, the student must choose 
three
 of the Elective Courses.
**Math majors may use 
MA 37500
 in place of 
CS 18200
 as a pre-requisite for other CS courses, but 
MA 37500
 will not count toward the five (5) CS courses.  In this case, the student must choose 
three
 of the Elective Courses.
