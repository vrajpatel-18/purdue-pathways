computational
finance, consulting,
information security,
wireless systems,
embedded systems,
and biotechnology.
Many also go on to
graduate or
professional school
in areas such as
engineering,
business, law, or
medicine.
The Department
also offers a Data
Science program. A
major in data
science puts
graduates at the
forefront of an
emerging field and
prepares them for
an exciting career at
the intersection of
computer science
and statistics. Data
Science is the
interdisciplinary field
of inquiry that uses
quantitative and
analytical methods
to help gain insights
and predictions
based on big data.
Students learn
about key
computational
methods and
statistical
techniques and
develop the deep
analytical thinking
skills needed to
reason reliably,
intelligently and
creatively from data.
The vast amounts of
data generated
every day has
created a data-rich
and data-driven
world. The data
science major opens
pathways to careers
in virtually every
area of society, from
healthcare, security
and sustainability to
education, business
---
and economics.
The department is
located in the
Lawson Computer
Science Building,
which opened in
2006. In addition to
offering an inviting
and comfortable
environment, the
building is equipped
with cutting-edge
networking and
computing
technologies,
including 10-gigabit
Ethernet cabling and
wireless access
throughout the
building. There are
four classrooms, five
instructional labs,
five research labs,
and a student
activity center. The
building also offers
students a variety of
interaction areas,
and a deli-style café
and espresso bar. A
16-by-9 foot tiled
video wall is used
for a variety of
purposes, including
notices of campus
events, workshop
and colloquium
speakers, news and
information, sporting
events, research
demonstrations, and
class projects.
The Purdue
Computer Science
Department offers a
Bachelor of Science
(BS), a minor in
computer science,
or a 5-year
combined BS/MS
degree. The
department also
offers an Honors
Program, and the
opportunity to
participate in the
Cooperative
Education Program.
A transfer program
is also available,
TSAP in Computer
