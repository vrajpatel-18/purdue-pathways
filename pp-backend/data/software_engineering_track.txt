Software Engineering Track
Objectives
The track is designed to prepare students to become software engineers who:
understand and can use the principles and techniques of software engineering essential for the design and development of large software products,
are familiar with and can effectively use a variety of tools for software analysis, design, testing, and maintenance, and
can effectively work in teams and communicate orally and in writing.
All major required courses, all track requirements and track selectives, and their pre-requisites, regardless of department, must be completed with a grade of C or better
.
