Great Issues in Science
Curricular Outcomes: ability to think and function as a scientist and demonstrated breadth of knowledge
This important core requirement challenges College of Science students to apply their critical thinking and analytical abilities
gained from engagement in their major area of study to the global conversation regarding the impact of Science on society and
the ramifications of scientific advances.
Curricular Notice:
Courses which have been taken to meet the Great Issues requirement may not also be used to meet a student's
Culture/Diversity or General Education requirement. AP, IB, and A LEVEL credit will not meet the Great Issues Requirement.
Transfer courses from accredited institutions may be submitted to as student's advisor for review by the Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Education.
